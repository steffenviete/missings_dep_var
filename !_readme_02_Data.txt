Data access:

The firm data of the ZEW ICT survey was collected by computer assisted telephone interviews. The firms were guaranteed that the survey results will be treated confidential in compliance with the German data protection regulation and only be used for scientific purposes. The data thus may not be processed or used for any other purposes, in particular commercial or any other business related purposes.

Therefore, the data unfortunately cannot be made publicly available on the internet. However, the data can be quickly made available through the ZEW Research Data Centre (ZEW-FDZ) and send to independent researchers upon signing a user agreement with ZEW – Leibniz Centre for European Economic Research, L7, 1, 68161 Mannheim, Germany. For fast processing of the application, one can always contact the person in charge of the ZEW-FDZ (see https://www.zew.de/WS50-1). The usage agreement (included in this replication package) is free of charge and allows independent researchers to access the data set to replicate the findings in the article and conduct original research. 

Besides the electronic transmission of the data subject to signing the data usage contract, the estimation sample data is at any time available for on-site use at the ZEW-FDZ (see https://www.zew.de/WS50-1).

In addition, in order to provide a workable version of the code, this replication package includes an artificial sample. This data is included in the data folder of the replication package. The metric variables are draws from the kernel density distribution of the original data and no longer meet the true information. While this synthetic data allows to run the code, results will deviate from the original results in the paper.

Note: In order to run the scripts, you need to set the projectpath variable to your directory and comment/uncomment relevant lines, depending on which version of the data you want to use.
